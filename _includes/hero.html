        <p>WebAssembly - or <strong>wasm</strong> for short - is a new binary syntax for low-level code on the web platform; and this website acts as a news aggregator on the topic.</p>
        <p>If you are interested to contribute a post, feel free to do so. The site is hosted on GitHub using jekyll; it would only require you to make a pull request with your link or content in a markdown file. Have a look at the <a href="/contributing.html">how to</a>.</p>
        <p>WASM.NEWS is an branch of the <a href="https://js.org" target="_blank">JS.ORG</a> initiative. Until JavaScript gets overtaken by WebAssembly you may also want to have a look at <a href="http://news.js.org">NEWS.JS.ORG</a>.</p>
